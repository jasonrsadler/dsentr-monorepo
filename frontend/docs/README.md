# Dsentr User Documentation

Welcome to the Dsentr documentation hub. Dsentr is a modular no-code automation platform with a React + TypeScript frontend and a Rust backend. These guides walk end users through setting up accounts, onboarding workspaces, building workflows, and managing automations inside the app.

## How to Use These Docs

- **[Getting Started](./getting-started.md)** – Create an account, verify your email, accept invites, and complete workspace onboarding.
- **[Dashboard Overview](./dashboard.md)** – Learn how the authenticated dashboard is structured, how workspace switching works, and where to find global actions.
- **[Settings & Administration](./settings.md)** – Manage plans, members, integrations, secrets, engine limits, logs, and webhooks.
- **[Workflow Designer](./workflow-designer.md)** – Understand the canvas, toolbar, and run controls used to design and operate automations.

Each page references the live product behavior implemented in the frontend codebase so you can rely on these instructions while using Dsentr today. If you are new to automation platforms, start with Getting Started and progress in order.
