# Google Picker configuration for local development
# Copy this file to `.env` in the `frontend/` folder or set these vars in your environment.

VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id_here

# Notes:
# - Enable the Drive and Picker APIs in Google Cloud Console for the project that owns these credentials.
# - Add your app origin (e.g. http://localhost:5173) as an Authorized JavaScript origin for the OAuth client.
# - The backend keeps refresh tokens; the frontend only needs a short-lived access token obtained from /api/google/token.
